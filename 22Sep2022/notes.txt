HTML Attributes:

Every HTML element has attributes. 

An attribute enhances the capability of a HTML element.

 <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="enter username">

 From above, type id  placeholder are the attributes of input.

 HTML provides 3 types of Attributes.

  Some Elements have their own attributes which can be used only with those 
  elements.

<head>
    <style>
        .red_center {
            text-align: center;
            color: red
        }
    </style>

</head>

<body>

    <h1 style="text-align: center"> Digital Lync</h1>
    <p class="red_center"> This is a paragraph!</p>
    <h3 class="red_center">This is another header</h3>
</body>

</html>


 3. Event Attributes:

   if  any action need to be performed on an HTML element, then we can use 
   event attributes.

   event attributes help HTML to connect with javascript.

</head>

<body>

    <button onclick="displayGreetings()">Greetings</button>

    <button onclick="login()">Login</button>

    <input oncopy="return false" onpaste="return false" placeholder="enter account number" type="number">

    <script>
        function displayGreetings() {
            alert("Good Morning! Have a great day!");
        }
        function login() {
            alert("Login function called");
        }

    </script>

</body>

From the above, onclick oncopy onpaste are the event attributes.
